## Future Ideas

Here are some planned ideas and features for future releases:

- **macOS Support**: While full macOS support is planned, an **experimental version** is already available. Check it out here: [Experimental macOS Build](https://github.com/ddxy/whispercat/actions/etc). Feedback is welcome!
- **Microphone Selection Improvements**: Revamp the microphone selection process to make it more user-friendly and intuitive.
- **Icon Fixes**: Refine and improve icons and UI graphics for better display on all platforms.
- **Audio Format Options**: Allow users to choose the output audio format (e.g., WAV, MP3).
- **Multiple Language Support**: Expand GUI and transcription support to more languages.
- **Custom Shortcuts**: Add the ability to configure custom hotkeys for various actions.
- **Audio Playback**: Integrate audio playback functionality for recorded files directly within the application.
- **Continuous Recording Mode**: Enable a mode for long-term recording sessions with automatic splitting of large files.
- **Much more**: Maybe another way to package the application

Feel free to contribute any of these features or suggest new ones in the issues section!
